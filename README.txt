Steps to use:
Open the code editor like jupyter or google colab where you can install packages. Like in Jupyter type- !pip install abhiprime
One can also use command prompt. Open the path where python is installed and type- pip install abhiprime
Once installation is done open your IDE and type- import abhiprime or import abhprime as ap.
Press enter. 
Now type- abhiprime.test_prime(any number which you want to check) 
If you are using alias name for abhiprime then type- ap.test_prime(any number which you want to check)
If you get ModuleNotFoundError (It may happen if you install via command prompt), then make sure that path specified for python is correct and is added in environment path variable.
